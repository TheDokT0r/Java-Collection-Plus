# Java-Collection-Plus
 
## What's this rep?
It's a simple library for Java that adds a list feature. The list hold Object types, which means it can hold pretty much any kind of type or object that you want.
Collection+ Adds a bunch of cool features that don't exist in the vanilla array list that's included with Java. Collection+ takes fetures from Python and C# lists, and add them into Java in a fast and responsive way.

## Why should I use this package?
As I said before, it adds a lot of fetures that don't exist in vanila Java.
This package is also rather fast, as I tries my best to not use loops to add or distruct data from the list.

## Requierments for usage:
This packages was created using Java 17. But the source code should work with any Java version that that supports the "System.arraycopy()" function.
As it's a Java application, the code should also work with Kotlin just fine.
